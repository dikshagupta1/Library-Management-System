## Library Management System - Project Description
### Introduction
The Library Management System project is a basic C++ application that allows users to manage a collection of books. The application provides common operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and borrowing books.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to implement a simple and efficient Library Management System that adheres to good coding practices and demonstrates the ability to structure a C++ application effectively.

### Key Requirements
The application includes the following features:
- Add a book to the library with details such as title, author, year, and availability status.
- Search for a book by title, author, or number.
- Borrow a book, meaning marking it as unavailable.
- Return a borrowed book, meaning marking it as available again.
- Display a list of all the books in the library.
- Persist data using file storage (e.g., plain text or JSON) to ensure data is saved between program runs.
